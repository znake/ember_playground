ember_playground
----------------

ember_playground is a simple Rails 3 Application that makes it easy to get
started with [ember.js](http://www.github.com/emberjs/ember-js) and [Ruby on
Rails](http://www.github.com/rails/rails).

It bundles [ember-rails](http://www.github.com/emberjs/ember-rails) for
handlebars template-compilation and
[hamlbars](http://www.github.com/jamesotron/hamlbars) to make it possible to
write your handlebars-templates with haml.

ember_playground does not use ember-rails's ember version but a recent version
of ember's master branch. It comes bundled with the following versions of 
ember.js and ember-data: 

- emberjs/ember-js@a5d45f6
- emberjs/data@2ac66cd2
