ember_playground
----------------

ember_playground is a simple Rails 3 Application that makes it easy to get
started with [ember.js](http://www.github.com/emberjs/ember.js) and [Ruby on
Rails](http://www.github.com/rails/rails).

It bundles [ember-rails](http://www.github.com/emberjs/ember.rails) for
handlebars template-compilation and
[hamlbars](http://www.github.com/jamesotron/hamlbars) to make it possible to
write your handlebars-templates with haml.

ember_playground does not use ember-rails's ember version but a recent version
of ember's master branch. It comes bundled with the following versions of 
ember.js and ember-data: 

- emberjs/ember-js@[a5d45f6](http://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/a5d45f66e1f71bb5eda417c688db0ea08b474903)
- emberjs/data@[2ac66cd2](https://github.com/emberjs/data/commit/2ac66cd2df43d17fd25386272d526807a9719c3d)
